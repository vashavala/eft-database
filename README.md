# just a title
currently I try to work on some data collect from 2 channels

[tarkov fandom](https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/)

and

[sp tarkov](https://dev.sp-tarkov.com/SPT/Server/src/branch/3.10.0-DEV/project/assets/database)

I will try to align these 4 resources: pvp, pve, tarkov fandom, sp tarkov.

But I believe pvp should be seen as a standard, for obvious reason.

Feel free to join me here.
